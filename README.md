# Customer-Churn-Detection-Modeling
This project builds a deep learning model using a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) to predict customer churn with the Telco Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle. Extensive feature engineering, including interaction, temporal, and behavioral features, enhances prediction accuracy and offers actionable insights for customer retention strategies.
